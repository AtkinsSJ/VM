ROADMAP:

-- Key --
- TODO
o Done
x Cancelled

o Basic commands:
	STORE, LOAD, ADD
o Branching:
	IF skips next instruction if accum is 0
	SKIP jumps so many instructions ahead
- Boolean logic:
	AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, XOR, XNOR
o User input:
	GET, GETC
- Pointers:
	Being able to access memory locations, and jump to lines, bsed on
	the value of a memory location. Using a location as a pointer is
	specified by putting an & before its address.
- More low-level functions:
	Related to pointers, rewrite commands to use a get_address()
	function, rather than repeating the code. Similar for any other
	generic actions.
